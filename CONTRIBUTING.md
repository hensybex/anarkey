- ABAC and RBAC enhancements.
- Configuration via Vault, AWS/GCP Secret Managers.
- Extended hooks (OnLogin, OnLogout, OnRefresh).
- Clients for Flutter, Dart, TypeScript.
- RFC7807-compatible error responses.

- Tests: Unit, Integration, Fuzzing.
- CI/CD pipelines.

## 🎯 Core Principles of AnarKey:

- Minimalism.
